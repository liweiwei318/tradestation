This folder is for the TradeStation 's function with extension *.eld

However, the *.eld is a binary format for EasyLanguage.
In order to avoid the ELD file format or version issue which may cause the import to TDE fail.
Therefore, we have to provide a pure plain-text source code for each function or indicator

For example:
  TTM_SEQUEEZE.ELD
  TTM_SEQUEEZE.txt

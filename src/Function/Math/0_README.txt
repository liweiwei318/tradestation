Mathematical and Trigonometric
As appears from the section title, this section collects mathematical and trigonometric functions. Besides traditional functions such as sine, cosine, or logarithm, the section also contains some more specific ones. For example, it has the isNaN function that defines if a parameter is a number, or the Round function that rounds a value to a certain number of digits.

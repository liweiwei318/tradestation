Stock Fundamentals
The Stock Fundamentals group functions return values of financial statement metrics of publicly quoted companies. By default, the values are returned for the currently selected symbol and are based on the annual reporting data. Some of the functions can return the values based on quarterly reporting data (see the article on the FiscalPeriod.QUARTER constant).
